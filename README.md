## SynGestures

This tool was originally developed in 2013 to bring more gestures to Synaptics touchpads. It's based on [two-finger scroll](http://code.google.com/p/two-finger-scroll), a cpp tool developed many years ago. The code was enhanced and rebranded in the `cpp-version` branch and rewritten in .NET/C# in the master branch.
